	abstract = {Research data as an integral part of the scholarly record is increasingly attracting attention of all stakeholder groups. Higher education institutions, funding agencies, policy makers as well as the public at large see benefits in accelerating science through opening access to research data. More specifically, this aims at better re-usability and verification of research findings. The latter is particularly of great interest for higher education and other research institutions, as they embody scholarly scrutiny and trust. Once established as an university of a new type that should unify research and teaching, Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t has recently created a new job position to develop an institutional concept for research data management. In this paper we present the initial situation along with preliminary survey findings and draw the consequences for multidisciplinary higher education institutions by taking the example of Humboldt-UniversitÃ¤t zu Berlin (HU).},
